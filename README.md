# AWS Blueprints 🚀

A curated collection of real-world AWS infrastructure examples, automation scripts, and architectural patterns — designed to demonstrate best practices, improve hands-on skills, and serve as a personal reference toolkit for cloud engineering.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository showcases my ongoing journey in mastering AWS by building production-grade cloud architectures, exploring AWS services in depth, and applying Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles using tools like Terraform and CloudFormation.

Whether you're a cloud engineer, DevOps practitioner, or simply exploring AWS, these blueprints offer modular, reusable setups that can be easily adapted to your own projects.

## 📁 Structure Overview

The repository is organized by topic:

- `00-common/` – Reusable modules (IAM, VPCs, etc.)
- `01-networking/` – VPC, NAT gateways, subnet design
- `02-compute/` – EC2, Auto Scaling, ECS/Fargate
- `03-storage/` – S3, EFS usage examples
- `04-database/` – RDS, DynamoDB integrations
- `05-serverless/` – Lambda, API Gateway, Step Functions
- `06-devops/` – CI/CD with CodePipeline, GitHub Actions
- `07-monitoring/` – CloudWatch, X-Ray, logging setups

Each section includes:
- Infrastructure code (Terraform or YAML)
- Architecture diagrams (where useful)
- A README with explanations and deployment instructions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **AWS Services:** EC2, VPC, IAM, RDS, Lambda, S3, CloudWatch, etc.
- **IaC:** Terraform (primarily), with some CloudFormation examples
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline
- **Monitoring & Security:** CloudWatch, IAM Policies, AWS Config

## ✅ Status

🧱 Continuously evolving as I explore more advanced concepts and build new patterns.  
📌 Contributions and feedback are welcome as long as they follow best practices.
