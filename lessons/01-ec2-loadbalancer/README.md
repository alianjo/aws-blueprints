# Lesson 1: EC2 Instance Basics ðŸš€

This lesson demonstrates how to create a basic EC2 instance using Terraform. You'll learn about instance types, AMIs, and basic AWS infrastructure concepts.

## What You'll Learn

- Creating an EC2 instance with Terraform
- Understanding instance types and AMIs
- Basic AWS infrastructure concepts
- Working with Terraform configuration

## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/     # Terraform configuration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.tf        # Main Terraform configuration
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # This file
```

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform installed

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the infrastructure directory:
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. Review the execution plan:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

4. Apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

## What's Included

- Basic EC2 instance configuration
- Amazon Linux 2 AMI
- t2.micro instance type
- Proper tagging for resource management

## Cleanup

To destroy the created resources:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Next Steps

- Try different instance types
- Add security groups
- Configure user data scripts
- Add more AWS services
